<p>Iv'e always loved computers but,when I was growing up they weren't really big then. I remember when I first went to computer lab in Buffalo ,N.Y. schools there sat a big Apple computer I was thrilled,and wanted nothing more than to find out what that big machine had in  store. The Computer mind you is nothing like we have today, it was bulky ,had floppy disks, and was always shutting down do to dial up internet,  [not something you want to deal with if you have a big presentation the next day,] but , to make a very long story short , since tech is what it is now, we  can do a lot more, with it,and 20 times better and faster, now with that said" iv'e done nothing more than trying to keep up, but , all that aside ,Iv'e always loved wanting to type,blog, get to know people , have a fun job,career,and life something I haven't had yet ,but will,when i'm done at Flatiron School. </p>
